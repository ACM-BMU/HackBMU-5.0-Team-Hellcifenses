## Tagline : 

A partnership between Brazil and India for Mumbai.

## Our Motivation and Objective :

Bombargain was created with the aim of locating and offering the best places and deals to the user or tourist who is visiting the city of Mumbai. With that in mind, our goal is to provide our users with the best options to decide how to spend their money.

We chose this city as the starting point for our idea, as it is a great commercial center and also an attractive point for tourism in India. We plan to gradually expand our database to provide the service to several other cities across India.

According to NASSCOM, even during the Covid-19 pandemic and challenges, the online market in India maintains a growth of 5% per year, proving to be a very viable business strategy.

Still, incentives for those who are not in it to enter in less brutal ways are necessary, and Bombargain also helps in this matter.

## Our target audience :

Bombargain is the perfect choice for anyone who lives in, or is visiting the city of Mumbai. With simple steps, you'll be able to discover the best offers and products, as well as restaurants to taste the amazing local food (such as Vada Pav) and tickets to experience the rich culture this city has to offer (like visiting Film City and indulging in Bollywood).

## The problem it solves :

Mumbai is well known for its tasty local food. Every street corner is a chance to taste new dishes and flavors. However, with so many places to visit, it's hard to get your small business the attention it deserves.

Bombargain's main functionality is to locate and highlight the local marketplace in Mumbai, focusing on small or medium-sized businesses, and making it easier to find awesome places and some hidden gems that can go unnoticed by tourists or residents. Whether it's local food, local products or services, in Bombargain you'll find everything that Mumbai has to offer.

## How it works :

By creating an account, the user will be able to find and locate a wide variety of places, such as restaurants, supermarkets, street food stalls, and much more.

Who doesn't like a good bargain ?

Bombargain offers the users the possibility to compare the average price of establishments in Mumbai, allowing their money to be spent in the best possible way. It also highlights the places with discounts on their products, so you can save up money.

## Challenges we had :

At the beginning we had to do some research about the indian market, so we could have some ideas for different kinds of business that would be worth to create in India, more specifically in Mumbai. We also had some difficulties with the time zone in India, because it is 8:30 hours ahead of our time zone ( Three members of our group are Brazilians ).

The language barrier was also a problem, to a certain extent, as we managed to get around this through the use of a mechanism such as Google Translate, as the team has 3 Brazilians from Recife, and 1 Indian from Mumbai. But English was used as the language of communication among the entire team.

## Project Maintenance :

In order to keep the website up and running and to make a profit, we'll use Google Adsense to generate revenue, which pay us for each visit or click on any Google Ads displayed on our page.
